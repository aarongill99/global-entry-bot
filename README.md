A Twitter bot that announces open Global Entry interview slots.

Based largely on [oliversong/goes-notifier](https://github.com/oliversong/goes-notifier),
[mvexel/next_global_entry](https://github.com/mvexel/next_global_entry),
and [this comment](https://github.com/oliversong/goes-notifier/issues/5#issuecomment-336966190).
